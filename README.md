# NEW YORK CITY TAXI FARE PREDICTION

As there is an amassed evolution in the metropolitan zones, urban data are apprehended and have become certainly manageable for first-hand prospects for data â€“ driven analysis 
which can be recycled for an improvement of folks who lives in urban zone.  This particular project highlights the prevailing focus on the dataset of NYC taxi trips and fare. Traditionally the data captured from the NYC Taxi & Limousine commission was physically analysed by various analyst to find the superlative practice to follow and derives the output from it which would eventually aids the people who commute via taxis.

BigData can effortlessly analyse the thousands of GB within a fractions seconds and expedite the process. This data can be analysed for several purposes like avoiding traffics, lower rate where services are not functioning more frequency than a cab on crown location and many more.  This information can be used by numerous authorities and industries for their own purpose.  Government official can use this data to deliver supplementary public transport 
service. The company like Uber can use this data for their own taxi service.

New York City taxi rides paint a vibrant picture of life in the city. The millions of rides taken each month can provide insight into traffic patterns, road blockage, or large-scale events that attract many New Yorkers. With ridesharing apps gaining popularity, it is increasingly important for taxi companies to provide visibility to their estimated fare and ride duration, since the competing apps provide these metrics upfront. Predicting fare and duration of a ride can help passengers decide when is the optimal time to start their commute, or help drivers decide which of two potential rides will be more profitable, for example. Furthermore, this visibility into fare will attract customers during times when ridesharing services are implementing surge pricing.
In the last few years, the number of for-hire vehicles operating in NY has grown from 63,000 to more than 100,000.
 However, while the number of trips in app-based vehicles has increased from 6 million to 17 million a year, taxi trips have fallen from 11 million to 8.5 million. 

Our dataset contains features such as: the location and time of the pickup, the location of the drop-off point, and the number of passengers.
As we discovered multiple cases of bad data, we started off by identifying and filtering out this dirty data.

Objective of this project is as follows- We will be using New York Taxi Fare dataset from Kaggle for this project. Machine learning is applied to this dataset to predict the fare amount. We will use Linear Regression and Random Forest. The first step was to turn the predictive model into a real-time API. We wanted to make our work useful and accessible to non-technical users. The core objective of this is to analyse the factors for demand for taxis, to find the most pickups, drop-offs of public based on their location, time of most traffic  and how to overcome the needs of the  public.
